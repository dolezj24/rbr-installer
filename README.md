## RBR Installer ##

Script usage

1. Put rbr files to install into rbr-files directory.
2. Keep RichardBurnsRally.ini as it is in rbr-files directory in repository (without XRes and YRes at the end).
3. Compile script with LZMA compression.

IMPORTANT: Installer size is limited to 2 GB. For workaround see branch installer_for_7zipSFX. 

Community installer (with page for RBRTM plugin account details) can be made by uncommenting line "Page custom AccPageFunc AccPageFuncLeave".

## RBR Installer ##

Script usage

1. Put rbr files to install into rbr-files directory.
2. Keep RichardBurnsRally.ini as it is in rbr-files directory in repository (without XRes and YRes at the end).
3. Compile script with BZIP2 compression.

IMPORTANT: Installer size is limited to 2 GB.

Possible workaround (not tested): use 7-zip self extracting archive to copy files, including installer compiled with ``File /r "rbr-files\"`` line omitted, and option to run installer after extracting.
